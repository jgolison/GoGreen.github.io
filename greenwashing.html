        </h2>
        <p class="info">First coined in 1983, the term ‘greenwashing’ refers to the false and misleading claims by companies and corporations regarding eco-friendly products, practices, and policies. Companies will greenwash in their advertisements, branding, or packaging in order to attract consumers that might be drawn to products that seemingly help the environment. However, these companies are polluting, wasting, and generally contributing to environmental disaster in various ways. It is crucial to recognize and call out greenwashing otherwise these corporations will profit off of environmental causes. Consumers that value sustainability will often believe greenwashing efforts and continue to unknowingly support companies that are emitting, polluting, etc, when they might believe they are supporting a company that is ‘committed’ to saving the planet.  </p>
