        <p class="info">You selected Exxon Mobile as your choice for Oil. Despite their public environmental plans and efforts, they are actually contributing even more to the climate crisis and environmental degradation! They say they are converting to clean energy via natural gas, however, natural gas is a fossil fuel and a nonrenewable energy. While it might produce a slight decrease in carbon emissions than oil, it is still a huge detriment to the environment. At the time of Exxon’s environmental announcements, they were advancing with a Texas natural gas facility that equates to a coal plant, a Kazakhstan natural gas facility that equates to two coal plants, and a Guyana oil refinery that will emit 1.1 million metric tons of CO2 in 2025. Don’t let these corporation greenwashing publicity stunts fool you!
