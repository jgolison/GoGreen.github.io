           <p class="info">Aramco’s 100+ oil and gas fields include the world’s largest offshore oil field, the largest shale gas field outside the U.S., and the world’s second largest onshore oil field.

The combination of Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP, and Total’s reserves are incomparable to those of Aramco. Every year, Aramco is expanding and exploiting more oil fields and increasing their maximum sustainable capacity to 13 million barrels of oil a day.

Don’t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you!</p>
