           <p class="info">BP’s “Keep Advancing” and “Possibilities Everywhere” campaigns sure sound amazing. However, there are two caveats to the campaigns. The first is that many of the solutions they proposed are not solutions at all, for example, natural gas is not a clean renewable energy. 

The second is that BP’s campaigns are all talk, they don’t contribute to the furthering of any of these solutions. Instead they are one of the largest contributors to emissions of greenhouse gases. 

Don’t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you!</p>
