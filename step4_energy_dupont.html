           <p class="info">DuPont’s commerical was adorable and eluded to a bright future for sealife. The jumping dolphins, clapping seals, and hopping penguins brought a sense of hope and pure joy.

In reality, DuPont was the single largest corporate polluter in the year that ad was aired. Upwards of 348 million pounds of pollutants were released into the environment, and that was back in the 1990s, you don’t even want to know how much they’ve polluted since. 

Don’t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you!</p>
