           <p class="info">RWE says they are one of the world’s largest producers of wimnd and solar energy, but the evidence doesn’t back them up. Instead, they are one of Eurpoe’s largest contributors to emissions.

Their goal to be carbon neutral by 2040 sounds incredible, but is virtually  impossible since they are only driving up the amount of gas they sell and burn. RWE is literally destroying a village in order to expand a coal plant. They are also suing the Netherlands over their environmental policies! And RWE says they are committed to saving the planet....

Don’t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you!</p>
