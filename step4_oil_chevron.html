           <p class="info">Chevron loves to point out how other sectors, like televsion, are polluting the environment, but somehow they are eluding all pollution their oil corporation is causing.

Let’s talk about the “The People Do” television ads that show butterflies and bears. At the time Chevron aired these ads they were violating both the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.

Don’t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you!</p>
