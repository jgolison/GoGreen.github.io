           <p class="info">Despite Eni’s idealistic and optimistic claim, their “Green Diesel” is nothing near green. While it sounds great, the term biofuel does not mean it is environmentally safe. Especially when the ingredient in this biofuel is palm oil. 

Eni’s use of palm oil for their Green Diesel has led to massive crop deforestation and overal damaging environmental effects. They ended up being fined 5 million Euros for their false information about Green Diesel.

Don’t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you!</p>
