           <p class="info">Exxon says they are converting to clean energy via natural gas, however, natural gas is a fossil fuel and a nonrenewable energy. While it might produce a slight decrease in carbon emissions than oil, it is still a huge detriment to the environment.</p> 
        <p class="info">
At the time of Exxon’s environmental announcements, they were building a Texas natural gas facility that equates to a coal plant, a Kazakhstan natural gas facility that equates to two coal plants, and a Guyana oil refinery that will emit 1.1 million metric tons of CO2 in 2025.</p>
