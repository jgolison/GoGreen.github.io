           <p class="info">Shell loves posting on Twitter and asking the world how they reduce their emissions. They seemed to leave out the part where their emissions were 1.38 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2020, the year this was tweeted. 

Shell also states that they are devoted to maintaing and preserving biodiversity, yet their pollution is among the deadly threats to biodiversity.

Donâ€™t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you!</p>
