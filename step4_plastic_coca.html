           <p class="info">Coca Cola’s revolutionary new plastic that is fully recyclable sounds incredible! Unfortunately it simply isn’t true. The PlantBottles contained a maximum of 15% recycled plastic, a small percentage and certainly not the 30% they boasted.

 There is no evidence to suggest that the PlantBottle has any benefit on the environment, nor that it results in a reduction of emissions. 

Don’t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you! Stop buying single-use plastic, and stop buying into the false advertising.</p>
