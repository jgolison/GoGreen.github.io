           <p class="info">Did the phrases “compostable” or “recyclable” draw your attention? These coffee pod companies sure know how to make their extremely wasteful, single-use capsules sound like a sustainable effort.

However, programs such as the Nespresso Capsule Recycling Program require the consumer to take their pods to a Nespresso store. Even Nespresso themselves have admitted that they recycle very few due to lack of access to drop off spots. As for those compostable pods, most of the time these can only be composted in industrial facilites - which again the typical consumer won’t put the time into.

Don’t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you! Don’t use these single-use coffee pods, instead research legitimate sustainable coffee companies.</p>
