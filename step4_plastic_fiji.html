           <p class="info">FIJI says that when you buy their water products your money will go into reducing emission and protecting Fijian rainforests, but there is in fact no data behind those claims. 

On the other hand, there is evidence that FIJI uses 46 million gallons of fossil fuel in their production and that they emit over 216,000,000 billion pounds of greenhouse gases every year! The green drop in their ads is nothing more that a misleading graphic.

Donâ€™t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you! Use a resuable water bottle! It will save you money and save the environment from immense plastic waste.</p>
