           <p class="info">Thought Innisfree’s paper bottle was going to be an awesome new sustainable packaging? We were fooled too. In reality, there is a plastic bottle inside of the paper bottle! Innisfree came out with claims that the slogan “Hello. I’m Paper Bottle” was only referring to the label.

They stated that this was an attempt to reduce plastic by avoiding a plastic label. However, many customers were left feeling betrayed after they thought that had bought an entirely paper bottle. 

Don’t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you! Do your research, look for bring your own or refill stores near you instead of buying new products in plastic containers.</p>
