           <p class="info">The ‘Keep America Beautiful’ campaign was launched by the very corporations responsible for massive waste (i.e. packaging, plastics, and food corps.). This includes McDonald’s, Coca Cola, etc. 

The goal of this campaign was simple: divert attention and blame from waste-producing corporations and instead place the responsibility on a typical American to pick up litter and ‘save’ America from waste.

Don’t let these corporation greenwashing publicity stunts fool you! Try going plastic-free instead, research bring your own/refill stores near you. Research the companies and corporations you are supporting!</p>
