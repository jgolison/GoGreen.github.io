           <p class="info">I’m sure you’ve heard “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” over and over again. Most people believe recyciling is one of the best ways to help the planet. The truth is that optimistically about 9% of recyclung actually gets recycled The rest gets thrown into landfills and incineration plants with the rest of your garbage.

Then why is recycling such a commonly known solution? Recycling has been popularized by corporations to offload their responsiblity in waste onto the consumer. By advertising that it is the consumer’s duty to recycle products, corporations are off the hook.

Don’t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you!</p>
