           <p class="info">Starbucks’ ‘recyclable’ and revolutionary drink lid falls quite short of its expectations. For starters, this lid will almost never actually get recycled. The type of plastic used gets recycled about 5% of the time.

Starbucks gives out over 8,000 single-use cups every minute. Only a miniscule percentage of these cups will end up in the recycling bin and only a miniscule percentage of those cups will even get recycled.

Don’t let these corporation greenwashing publicity stunts fool you! Avoid buying beverages in single-use plastics, research companies that let you bring in reusable cups, or make coffe at home!</p>
