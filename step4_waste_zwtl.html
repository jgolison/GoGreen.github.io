           <p class="info">The phrase ‘zero waste to landfill’ sounds awesome, it sounds like that company is putting effort in to help the planet. 

In reality, the companies that pledge “Zero Waste To Landfill” only have a target of recycling 50% of their waste, and most don’t reach that goal. The 50+% of waste that isn’t recycled ends up at incineration plants, which emit massive amounts of greenhouse gases and put their ashes right into landfills.

Don’t let these corporate greenwashing publicity stunts fool you!</p>
